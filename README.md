### 5 Lean Production Pipeline ###

+ Introducing lean production / rapid prototyping.
+ NOT pre-production, production, post-production.
+ Imagine these assets are for a bowling game.
+ Knowing how fast / how many iterations to do.
+ Knowing when to stop iterating!

**A Definition of Lean Production**

+ Eliminates waste created through overburden and unevenness in work loads.
+ Maximises flow of value (anything that a **customer** would be willing to pay for).
+ Maximises quality by discovering the 20% of gold.
+ [Lean Manufacturing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing)

**The Pottery Fable**  

+ Teacher challenges class.
+ One half on quality, other on quantity.
+ At the end of the term, which wins?
+ Both from the quantity side.
+ Moral… quality follows quantity.

### 6 Knowing Your Topic and Specification ###

+ Understanding your subject.
+ Planning your model.
+ Know the importance of research.

### 7 Blender Model Scale

+ Has it’s own units called Blender Units (BU)
+ You can define a Blender unit as several units.
+ Works well between 0.01 - 100 BU
+ Rule of thumb: Use the Grid Floor as a stage.
+ Order of magnitude suitable for the Level of Detail

+ Updated 27/09/2017

**Scale, Level of Detail and Models**

+ One model doesn't have to contain it all!
+ Use multiple models if necessary.
+ Imagine zooming in from space to a bacteria.
+ You would make multiple models for each level of detail.

### 8 Choosing The Right Primitive(s) ###

+ Starting with a primitive with the same symmetry and shape as your target model saves you time.
+ It can be very hard to remove all traces of the original shape.

### 9 Importing Reference Material ###

+ There are 2 ways of importing reference material.
+ Background images and textured planes.
+ We'll be using background images.

### 10 Introduction to Bézier Curves ###

+ What are are Bézier curves.
+ Why we're using them for our pin.
+ Drawing your first Bézier curve.

### 11 Spin In Blender (Rotational Extrusion) ###

+ Convert the curve to a mesh object.
+ Learn that a curve is still editable.
+ Using the spin tool we will make our pin.

### 12 Assigning Materials To Faces ###

+ Introduce the material properties panel.
+ How to create & name a material.
+ About users of materials & “deleting” materials.
+ How to assign a material to a face.

### 13 Exporting Models With Materials ###

+ How a .blend file may appear elsewhere.
+ How to export as a .fbx file with materials.
+ How using .blend is “leaner”.
+ About smooth shading & normals.
+ Why you may want multiple levels of detail.

### 14 Creating Collider Meshes ###

+ How to control the number of vertices.
+ Creating a Convex Hull.
+ Introducing the Decimate modifier.

### 15 Choosing The Right Sphere ###

+ Learn that the sphere is the defining shape.
+ The mesh topology can vary greatly.
+ UV sphere, ico sphere and cube!
+ Brief look at subdivision modifier.

### 16 Subdividing an Edge and To Sphere ###

+ Use the Subdivision tool to add edge geometry.
+ Use 'to sphere' to create a circular hole.

### 17 Extruding to a Normal ###

+ Change the axis for extrusion for finer control.

### 18 Importing Blender Files ###

+ Showing you how to import multiple Blender files into a scene.
+ Learning the difference between append and linked.
+ Understanding that a composited scene can exist with both types.

**Appended**

+ When making a scene with multiple models.
+ You have control over the model, scale, position etc.
+ Can edit the model, like taking a copy into the current Blender file.
+ e.g. Coffee table plus two cups…

**Linked**

+ When making an object of components.
+ You have no control over the models position, scale etc.
+ You still cannot edit the model, done at source.
+ e.g. An anatomical model…

### 19 Final Scene ###

Using the assets we have just created we will combine them in Blender into one
scene and compose the bowling balls so they are looking dynamic and awesome!

### 20 Fun With Physics
+ Use basic Physics to have the bowling ball hit the pin
+ Introduction to passive and active rigid body physics

### Section 3 Wrap Up ###

A final lecture concluding this section.
We hope you have enjoyed in and will see you in the next section.
